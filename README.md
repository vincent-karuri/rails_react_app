# Rails + React App

This project involves building a web app with a Rails API backend and a React.js front end.

The web app is an idea board which allows for creation of new ideas, updating/editing of existing ideas and deletion of existing ideas.

All these actions are supported by the Rails API backend which the React app calls for each user action.

The app is live at: https://afternoon-dawn-44140.herokuapp.com/.

# Rails + React App

This project involves building a web app with a Rails API backend and a React.js front end.

The web app is an idea board which allows for creating of new ideas, updating/editing existing ideas and deleting existing ideas.

All these actions are supported by the Rails backend API that the React app calls for each user action.

The app is live at: https://afternoon-dawn-44140.herokuapp.com/.
